2.1
===

*   Further simplified the internal IconsLibrary interface, so that possibly even more icon libraries are compatible.
*   `minify` is now optional and `true` by default.
*   Via the `svg` key custom SVG contents can now be passed instead of extracting it from feather by name. Omit the `name` parameter for this icon.

2.0
===

*   `feather-icons` was removed from the project and is supposed to be loaded in the project itself.
*   Port to TypeScript.
